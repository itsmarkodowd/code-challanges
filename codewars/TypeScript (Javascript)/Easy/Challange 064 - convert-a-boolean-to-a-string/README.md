# The Challange

```
A function is a block of code that takes an input and produces an output. In this example, boolean_to_string is a function whose input is either true or false, and whose output is the string representation of the input, either "true"/"True" or "false"/"False" (check the sample tests about what capitalization to use in a given language).

A common idea we often want to represent in code is the concept of true and false. A variable that can either be true or false is called a boolean variable. In this example, the input to boolean_to_string (represented by the variable b) is a boolean.
