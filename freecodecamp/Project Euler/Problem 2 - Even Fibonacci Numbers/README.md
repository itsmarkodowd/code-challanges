# The Challange

https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-2-even-fibonacci-numbers

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed nth term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

# My Answer

```
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  let firstNum = 0;
  let secondNum = 1;
  let fibNum = 0;
  let total = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++){
    fibNum = firstNum + secondNum;
    firstNum = secondNum;
    secondNum = fibNum;

    if (fibNum % 2 == 0){
      total += fibNum;
    }
  }
  // console.log(total);
  return total;
}

fiboEvenSum(10);
```

# Comments & Hurdles

* Fibonacci with conditional to check if FibNum is even then add to tally if so
